# 🎫 Ticketing Bot
An easy to use ticket style Discord bot written in JavaScript using the Discord.js library.
Fully customisable, easy to navigate and fully dynamic.

# 🛠 Setup
Run `npm install` to install all of the depenfor the bot to function properly.
Navigate to `.env` and insert your bot token, your guild ID and your bot prefix.

After that, you can edit some of the files to insert your own text, or, if you're really crafty, you can edit some of the code to make the bot suit your needs, however, I would only recommend doing this if you have experience in DJS, otherwise you might end up breaking the bot.

# 🖐 Permissions
The bot should hopefully catch and return all errors it may come across, including permission errors, however, it will need most of the base messaging permissions.
I would recommend giving the bot the *Administrator* permission, however, if you don't want to do that, give it these permissions:
* *Manage Messages*
* *Send Messages*
* *Read Messages*
* *Manage Channels*
* *Embed Links*
* *Attach Files*
* *Use External Emojis*
* *Use Application Commands* - This is a vital one, if you don't enable this, the bot cannot function.

It's more faff if you enable all of these seperately, so I'd just suggest giving the bot *Administrator* permissions,
